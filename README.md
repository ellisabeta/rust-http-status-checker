# HTTP Status Checker with Rust

CLI (Command Line Interface) application in Rust.
It runs in the terminal and accepts URLs which processes the request and gives out the status code.

All the logic of the application is in [./src/main.rs](./src/main.rs) file.

To run the application build and run it: `cargo build` `cargo run` or run with the target folder `./target/debug/grrs.exe`

To read documentation even offline run this command in the terminal: `rustup doc`
